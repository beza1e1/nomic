# Nomic

> Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move

This variant is intended to play nomic with a few friends over
longer time.

## Changes to the Common Initial Rules

* The rules were shortened and simplified to provide an easier start.

* The rules were adapted for asynchronous games,
  so there is no round or order between players.

* The game (initially) has a dictator,
  which simplifies the initial rules for judges and conflicts.
